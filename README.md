# Az Workspace Manager (Preview)

## Why this PowerShell Module

Currently the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace Manager (Preview) is only available through the Azure Portal of via de REST API.  
Because the Azure Portal is using API calls in the background, and because the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace Manager API  
contains some errors, I have decided to create a PowerShell Module called **AzWorkspaceManager**

This module is especially useful in scenario's where you want to manage the Workspace Manager using Infrastructure as Code or using pipelines.

## Common setup

### Prerequisites

- [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- [Clone this repository]()

  ```powershell
  Import-Module -AzWorkspaceManager
  ```

To get started with this PowerShell module you only need to follow some simple steps.
